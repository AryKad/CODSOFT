#💡 Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!
This space showcases the end-to-end ML solutions I've built as part of my self-learning journey and hands-on exploration of data science, artificial intelligence, and real-world problem-solving.

## ⚠️ Dataset Notice

Due to GitHub's file size restrictions, **large datasets and `.pkl` model files are not included** in the repository.

To run any project:
1. Download the respective dataset as mentioned in the task's README.
2. Place it in the appropriate folder.
3. Update the file path in the notebook or script if needed.
